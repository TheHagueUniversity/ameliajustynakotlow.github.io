      <h3><br>Programming Bootcamp - The Cat Game</h3>
        <br>
        <p>I’ve decided to improve my game. Thanks to gained skills and received guidance, I was able not only move the character, but also interact with space and objects. By combining set of commands main character (the Cat) can move forward and backward, attack the enemy (the Dog) dealing damage, and climb the tree to reach the Teleport. 
        <br>
        Thanks to simple and clean aesthetics game can be easily expanded with new challenges and adventures, with or without the plot. The simplicity of the visuals making the game easy to use for a wide range of users. Moreover, the difficulty of the levels could be diverse or increase while playing.

       <h3>Women&&Tech</h3>
            
        <p>Women&&Tech was launched in 2012 to feature interviews with different women working in the tech industry. I became familiar with them when I was invited to be one of the interviewees! A few years later, I joined the team and helped with the relaunch of the site as the front-end architect.</p>

        <h3>The Wire Ipsum</h3>
            
         <p>After coming back from teaching a JavaScript workshop, I felt inspired to create something just for fun. I realized that of all the content/lorem ipsum generators available, there was nothing for HBO’s The Wire fans. I searched for <a href="http://thewireipsum.com" target="_blank">thewireipsum.com</a> domain and it was available! Generate some content for your projects today.</p>
