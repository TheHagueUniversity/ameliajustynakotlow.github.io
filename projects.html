    <h2><br><br>P R O J E C T S<br></h2>
    <section><br> During the CMD-UXD course on the Hague University of Applied Sciences in The Hague, I was able to work on interesting and valuable assignments. I've selected few representative projects which are presented below. <br><br>If you will have any questions, don't hesitate to <a class="link2" href="contact.html" target="blank" title="contact"> contact me</a>:)</section><br>

    <h3>Bespoke Design - "Record a Song Together" card personalisation tool</h3>
      <p id="projecttext"> Nowadays we see more and more intangible gifts because of the increase in digital products and a growing interest in experiences. Intangible gifts can be digital products like e-books, games, movies, music, etc. <br><br>I’ve translated the ‘old’ rituals for giving experience to the digital context for people living far away from friends and family who want to express the emotional message. The client of this project is Hallmark CE whose idea is to help people show care and support in a form of sending emotional messages and gifts that will have an impact.

        <p id="projecttext"> Above is presented card cersonalisation tool prototype overview, where th gift giver is following the set of simple steps. Choosing the song which will be performedand recorded by both of them via app. Next step is designing the unique vinyl-shaped card and appying on it the emotional message. <br><br>

      <h3><br>Application Design - Design & Creativity Toolbox </h3>
        <p id="projecttext"> "Design and Creativity Toolbox" is an application allowing users to overview diverging and converging theory and techniques due to UXD criteria. Moreover, the tool gives an opportunity to create an account to save and edit individual projects/concepts, enriching them with photos, videos and notes (uploaded or shared by the user). </p>

      <h3><br><br>Programming Bootcamp - The Cat Game</h3>
        <br>
        <p id="projecttext"> Thanks to the Programming Bootcamp I've gained basic programming skills. I've learned how to create interactive and usable visuals like e.g. game by determining shapes and colours, conditionals, functions, loops and arrays.
        <br><br>
        In presented project The Cat Game I was able not only move the character, but also interact with space and objects. By combining set of commands main character (the Cat) can move forward and backward, attack the enemy (the Dog) dealing damage, and climb the tree to reach the Teleport. 
        </p>

        <img class="outline" src="images/cat3.png" alt="The Cat Game">
        
        <p id="projecttext"> Thanks to simple and clean aesthetics game can be easily expanded with new challenges and adventures, with or without the plot. The simplicity of the visuals making the game easy to use for a wide range of people. Moreover, the difficulty of the levels could be diverse or increase while playing.</p>
